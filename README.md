# Machine-Learning-Notes
## What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed.

Supervised and unsupervised learning are two fundamental approaches to machine learning that differ in their training data and learning objectives:

### Supervised Learning
- **Definition**: Supervised learning involves training a machine learning model on a labeled dataset, where each data point has a corresponding label or output value.
- **Goal**: The algorithm learns to map the input data to the desired output, allowing it to make predictions for new, unseen data.
- **Examples**:
  - Classification: Assigning categories to data points (e.g., support vector machines, logistic regression, decision trees).
  - Regression: Predicting continuous numerical values (e.g., linear regression, polynomial regression, ridge regression).
- **Advantages**:
  - Highly accurate predictions.
  - Can be used for tasks where the desired output is known.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires labeled training data.
  - Computationally complex.

### Unsupervised Learning
- **Definition**: Unsupervised learning involves training a machine learning model on an unlabeled dataset, where the data points do not have corresponding labels or output values.
- **Goal**: The algorithm learns to identify patterns and structures in the data without explicit guidance.
- **Examples**:
  - Clustering: Grouping data points into clusters based on their similarity (e.g., k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering).
  - Dimensionality reduction: Reducing the number of features in a dataset while preserving the most important information (e.g., principal component analysis, autoencoders).
- **Advantages**:
  - Does not require labeled training data.
  - Can find previously unknown patterns in data.
  - Can help gain insights from unlabeled data.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Difficult to measure accuracy or effectiveness due to lack of predefined answers during training.
  - Results often have lesser accuracy.
  - Requires time to interpret and label classes.

These two approaches are used in different scenarios and with different datasets, and the choice between them depends on the specific problem being solved, the data available, and the tools and experience needed to build and manage the models[1][2][3].
